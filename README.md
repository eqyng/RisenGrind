# Rise & Grind
i.e. if you ever need a Sydney cafe to do your thing at but don't know where

Based on criteria of: 
* table rent (for not-a-lot-of-discretionary-income-folk -- me)
* Wi-Fi (most often times they're okay with you taking up space)
* wall sockets 
* notes 
* table service or counter order
* noise level 
* bathrooms (a lot of visits cut prematurely because of protesting bladder)
* water
* music / vibes
