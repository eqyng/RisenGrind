# Rise & Grind
for the early birds on the work grind with the coffee grind 
i.e. if you ever need a Sydney cafe to do your thing at but don't know where

Based on criteria of: 
* Wi-Fi (most often times they're okay with you taking up space)
* wall sockets 
* noise level 
* bathrooms (a lot of visits cut prematurely because of protesting bladder)
* table rent (for not-a-lot-of-discretionary-income-folk - me)
* water
* table service or counter order
* music / vibes
* other notes
